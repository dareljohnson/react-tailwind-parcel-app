## Project Title

### React with Parcel and TypeScript

## Project Description

This repository contains the source code for a Starter React app, using Parcel as a package management and build system, and TypeScript.

## Assumptions

I assume you are developing this project on a Microsoft Windows PC. A built-in Windows tool like notepad.exe is used in this project to create and edit files. If you are developing on Linux, you can use vim.

```
notepad .gitignore
```

On Linux:

```
vim .gitignore
```


You can also use a modern code editor like VSCode to follow along.


## How to Use the Project

You can clone this project.

```
 git clone https://github.com/dareljohnson/react-tailwind-parcel-app.git
```

## How to Run the Project

Run the local application server:

## How to Build the Project for production

Build and package project for Production:

```
